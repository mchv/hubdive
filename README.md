## Introduction

Hubdive is a simple [play!](http://www.playframework.org/) application to dive into github repos and display some stats.
It uses the current [stable github api](http://develop.github.com/p/general.html). 
The application was created to *play* with the framework and several improvements could be made, for instance:

* Use the provided HTTP client instead of the created one
* Use the provided cache, instead of the created one
